vectrix: matrix of vectors
relative to N means that we already in the N frame
DCM have singularities, gimble lock. There's ambiguity at this points
If you use 4 coordinates enables to have non-singularities
DCM have 9 coordinates, but they have 6 constraints. Thus 3 degrees of freedom rof rotation
 
DCM first column cross 2nd = 3 column
DCM 1st row cross product 2 row = 3 row 
because they are right hand coordinate frames BN
DCM has no singularities

Proper orthogonal matrix means the determinant is 1
DCM are proper orthogonal

Addition of DCM means multiply so we go from one frame of reference 
to another

BN=NB.transpose()
BN is how I go to body frame from inertial frame
Identity matrix is like multiplying times 1

DCM differential
BN_dot=[omega_tilde_B_frame] [BN]

omega is what you measure with a rate gyro
DCM is my attitude
