euler angles:
The three angles perform successive rotations about primary coordinate frame axes 
without immediately repeating the same axis

* B frame relative to N is BN
The order of the rotation is important
12 sets of euler angles combinations
second sequence angle is where singularities occur
the sequence matters!
pitch, roll, and yaw, are examples of euler angles (3-2-1) sequence[asymmetric euler angles]
Orbital plane angles is a (3-1-3) sequence rotation[symmetric euler angles]
symmetric: 2nd angle, singularities at 0 or 180 degrees
asymmetric: 2nd angle, singularities at +/- 90 degrees

Mapping euler angles to rotation matrix:
for a (3-2-1) sequence, go like C=(1-2-3)  
To obtain final rotation matrix[RN]=[RB][BN]

Topographic frame is a frame surface of earth
Earth axit {n1,n2,n3}
n3 is polar axis, and n1 is Vernal equinox(celestial thing)

ex: 90 degree rotation about 3rd axis n3:

M3(90)=[[ cos(90)  sin(90)    0]
        [-sin(90)  cos(90)    0]
        [  0         0        1]]

Note that axis that doesn't rotate equals to 1 in row and column in matrix

**When doing inverse mapping back to euler angles from roation sequence matrix,
quadrant  must be checked with the inverse tangent function
